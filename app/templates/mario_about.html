    <p>My name is Mario Zuniga. I'm going to be a junior majoring in Computer Science at UC Berkeley. I'm from the Bay Area in California and have always 
        enjoyed learning about technology and software in particular. I aspire to become a software engineer one day and seek to work hard to do so. </p>
